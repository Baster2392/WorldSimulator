# World Simulator

Project made for an object-oriented programming course. It symulates  natural environment. The symulation contains plants, animals and human. Animals and plants differ from each other
in their abilities. For example, an antelope can move on distance two times longer than other animals, and guarana gives 2 additional attack points to an organism who consumes it. When two 
organisms meet in one position on the map, they fight. Result of the fight is determined by the organisms' stats. For example when an antelope (attack: 4, speed: 4) meet a wolf (attack: 9, speed: 5) 
result of fight is the antelope being defeated by the wolf.
