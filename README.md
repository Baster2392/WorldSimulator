# World Simulator

This project was created for an object-oriented programming course. It simulates a natural environment containing plants, animals, and humans. Animals and plants differ in their abilities. For example, an antelope can move a distance twice as long as other animals, and Guarana gives two additional attack points to an organism that consumes it. When two organisms meet on the map, they fight. The result of the fight is determined by the organisms' statistics. For example, when an antelope (attack: 4, speed: 4) meets a wolf (attack: 9, speed: 5), the result of the fight is the antelope being defeated by the wolf.
